In This Project we're going to see whether flood happens or not.
These are the code files here we have 3 modules and 4 algorithms.
now i'm going to implement the algorithms
the first algorithm is logistic regression the Accuracy result of this is 71.3 and these are the results of confusion matrix.
now the second algorithm is decision tree the accuracy result of this is 69.6 and these are the result of confusion matrix.
the third algorithm is random forest the accuracy result of this is 80.84 and these are the result of confusion matrix.
last one is support vector machine the accuracy result of this is 60.5 and these are the result of confusion matrix.
After checking these accuracy  values we will select the best algorthim in our case it is random forest 
so now we're using random forest algorithm and deploying this i have already prepared the file under flood.pkl sow now im just going to run this 
After running this we have to host the web portal address.
this is the main web interface now i'm running this by giving state and rainfall range to see whether the flood happen or not.
this is the final output.
